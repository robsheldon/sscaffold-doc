## The default theme

A default theme has been created, derived from milligram's theme but with slightly different color and typographical elements.

The theme section has been placed at the bottom of the file and further divided into a few subsections to support easy customization in the future.

### Typography

`font`-related rules, `line-height`, and similar rules are bundled together in a theme's "typography" subsection. This makes it easy to customize the typography of a site without having to crawl through the entire file.

### Layout

Rules which change the positioning or spacing of elements are gathered together in the "layout" subsection of a theme.

### Colors

Borders, colors, and lots of fine tuning for form elements are all in the "colors" subsection at the bottom of the theme section.
