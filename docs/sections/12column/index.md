## Support for skeleton's 12-column grid

[skeleton.css](http://getskeleton.com/)'s 12-column ruleset has been added to sscaffold to provide an upgrade path for sites already using skeleton.

If you are trying to update a skeleton-based design, you may want to look at the [differences from skeleton](../../diff/skeleton/index.md) page.

If you are starting a new project, you're probably better off using milligram's [flexbox-based columns](../../sections/flexbox/index.md) or just jumping ahead to [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).
